## Environment Variables

#### To run this project, you will need to pass these Variables while running maven project

    -Ddevice = Emulator/Real
    -Dgroups = web/hybrid/native
    -DtypaTestApp = web/hybrid/native




## Running Tests

### A] Run Configuration/maven CLI command:

```test -Dgroups=hybrid -Ddevice=Emulator -DtypeTestApp=hybrid```

#### Based of what type of testing want to perform, select appropriate value of variables.

##### -Ddevice = Emulator/Real 
    - select Emulator to execute test cases over Emulator
    - select Read to execute test cases over real mobile device

##### -Dgroups = web/hybrid/native
    - select value to execute all test cases tagged with corresponding group name
    
##### -DtypaTestApp = web/hybrid/native
    - the value you select based of which type of group you have selected. This parameter is used to set pre-requiresits e.g AppiumDriverLocalService, UiAutomator2Options

Here is the screenshot of Run Configuration for reference:

![Maven Run Configuration](https://github.com/swatinerkar/appium-testng-project/blob/main/images/RunConfigurations.png)

### B] Running using testng.xml

You can simply run testng.xml file by right clicking on file and select run

In want to execute only specific test, mark only that as enabled="true" and other as enabled="false". Then run testng.xml file.

### C] Run application on Read Device:
    1. Enable Developer Mode
        * Go to settings -> About device -> Build Number
        * Tap or click on that 7 times. You will get popup, showing developer mode is enabled now

    2. Open Developer Options
        * Go back to settings, and search for developer options
        * Open it and find USB debugging. By default it is disabled. Enable it.
        
    3. Code level
        * setDevice - options.setDeviceName("Android Device");

    4. Connect mobile/device to laptop/computer 
        * You will get a popup, click on 'allow'
        * Select use UBS for File transfer/Android Auto
    5. Check if device is connected
        * Open command prompt
        * Run command:- adb devices
        * You will see your device in the list.
                e.g. List of devices attached
                        c24823  device
    6. Run test case
    7. If you faced error: 'Exception occurred while executing 'delete': java.lang.SecurityException: Permission denial: writing to settings requires:android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS'
        * Go to developer option.
        * Go to last option called --> Disable Permission Monitoring --> enable it.
    8. Re-run test case
